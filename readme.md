### This is an unofficial bot‚ùó

Bot helps you get official exchange rates for currencies from National Bank of the Republic of Belarus.
All information provided here is not the direct one from NBRB. The author is not responsible for financial problems that may arise with currency exchange due to mishandling this information.

### It works from the cloud
Salesforce Cloud Platform - <a href="https://heroku.com/"> heroku.com</a>

### How it works
Information gathers from site that can be reached outside Belarus, cuz cloud service works from EU.
This process happens once between time when rates change to decrease requests to site and do not exceed the limit of free Heroku subscription.
Anyway we don't need to bother about refreshing this information more the once in a period due to rates update frequency.

### For whom it needs
For people who have some financial affairs in Belarus beside its border and who don't need anything else except info about exchange rates.
